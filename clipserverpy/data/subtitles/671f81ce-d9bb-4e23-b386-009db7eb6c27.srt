00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,120
And I'm Neil. Phew, I've spent a day in meetings, then shopping, then collecting the kids

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,920
from school. I'm exhausted, Beth. What have you been doing today?

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,320
Oh, not much, just sitting around, doing nothing, relaxing and kicking back.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,680
Lucky you, don't you have any work to do?

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,760
It may not look at Neil, but I'm actually as busy as a bee.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,840
If you've seen nature documentaries about worker bees flying from flower to flower,

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,760
you probably think animals are always on the move.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,680
But the surprising truth is, away from the cameras, most animals spend most of their time

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,640
doing absolutely nothing at all.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,720
In the natural world where finding food and shelter is hard work,

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,520
why have some animals evolved to do nothing?

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,400
And if it's good enough for animals, would being lazy work for humans too?

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,960
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme and, as usual,

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,680
we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,320
But first, let me work up the energy to ask you a question, Neil.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,760
Of course, some animals have a reputation for lounging about.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,240
Lions, for example, can sleep up to 20 hours a day.

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,320
But what is the slowest moving animal on earth?

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,560
Is it A, the giant tortoise, B, the three-toed sloth, or C, the koala?

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,040
Well, I think it's the three-toed sloth.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,920
OK, Neil. I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,000
Now, it's no surprise that lazy lions love relaxing,

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,680
but even animals with reputations for being busy spend time

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,440
doing nothing.

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,840
Look carefully into an ants nest,

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,160
and you'll see around half of them just sitting there motionless.

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,720
Here's Professor Dan Chabano, an expert in insect behaviour,

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,200
discussing the lazy rock ant with Emily Knight,

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,000
presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme Nature Bang.

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,480
Dan's research has focused on ant colonies,

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,560
a species called Temna Thorax Regardless, or the rock ant.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
I think ants are sort of a symbol of, like, industriousness.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
They have this whole tiny little society going on

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,680
that's kind of similar to ours.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,040
If some idealized version of what humans might be,

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,560
if we could only, like, pull it together and all work together,

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
we could be as industrious as the ants.

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,960
But then when you look at it, you know,

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,000
roughly about half the colony is inactive at any given time.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,640
We think ants are industrious or hardworking.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,000
Groups of ants called colonies seem tiny, perfect societies

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
where everyone works hard for the good of the group.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,160
Then why are so many of them inactive?

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,680
One possible answer is that they're reserve ants,

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,880
ready to step in if disease or disaster strike.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,720
But could it simply be that they don't work

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,600
because they don't need to?

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,280
Would you get out of bed on Monday morning if you didn't have to?

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,080
Maybe the ants can teach us a thing or two about relaxing,

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
but wouldn't it get boring just sitting around all day?

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,200
Not according to psychologist Dr Sandy Mann.

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
She thinks being productive,

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,880
working to produce a lot for the amount of resources we use

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,760
is overrated.

56
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,880
Boredom has its benefits too,

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,720
as she explained to BBC Radio 4 programme Nature Bank.

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,840
Would humans have invented bread or beer or fire,

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,680
you know, if we hadn't been bored

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,800
and were wondering what would happen if we mixed this with this,

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,440
you know, are all these sort of inventions the mother of boredom?

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,280
But in this world of constant stimulation,

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,560
switching off is harder than it's ever been.

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,920
That's why we're constantly swiping and scrolling

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,800
and looking for the next big thing and the new thing

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,960
and we get bored of things very quickly.

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,800
So it's a kind of paradox to get rid of this unpleasant state of boredom

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,800
is actually to allow more boredom into your life.

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,880
Dr Mann doubts humans would have invented things

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,480
without the curiosity that comes from being bored.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,880
Boredom is the mother of invention.

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
An idea based on the famous proverb,

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,200
necessity is the mother of invention,

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,960
an idiom meaning that if you really need to do something,

75
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,920
you will think of a way of doing it.

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,560
Instead of fearing boredom,

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,360
we can open up to its benefits by switching off,

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,760
stopping, worrying or thinking about something and relaxing,

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,840
slowing down helps too.

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,440
Something we can definitely learn from our animal cousins.

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,920
I think now is a good time to reveal the answer to my question

82
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,640
since we have nothing else to do.

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,240
You asked me to name the world's slowest animal

84
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,360
and I guessed it was the three-toed sloth.

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,400
Was I right?

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,800
That was the correct answer.

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,360
With the top speed of 30 centimeters per minute,

88
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,360
three-toed sloths move so slowly that algae grows on their coats.

89
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,040
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme

90
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,800
starting with the phrase kicking back

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
to stop doing things and relax completely.

92
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,080
The adjective industrious means hardworking.

93
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,640
A colony is the name given to a group of certain animals,

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,760
including ants and some sea beds.

95
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,240
Someone who is productive is able to produce a lot

96
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,200
for the amount of resources they use.

97
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,520
The proverb necessity is the mother of invention

98
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
means that if you really need to do something,

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
you will think of a way of doing it.

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,920
And finally, to switch off means to stop worrying

101
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,760
or thinking about something and relax.

102
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,680
Once again, our six minutes are up.

103
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,120
It must be time to sit down, close your eyes,

104
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,160
and just do nothing.

105
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
Goodbye for now.

106
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Bye.
