00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,780
Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,660
And I'm Neil. Phew, I've spent a day in meetings, then shopping, then collecting the kids from school.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,600
I'm exhausted, Beth. What have you been doing today?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,160
Oh, not much. Just sitting around, doing nothing, relaxing and kicking back.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,500
Lucky you. Don't you have any work to do?

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,320
It may not look it, Neil, but I'm actually as busy as a bee.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:44,320
If you've seen nature documentaries about worker bees flying from flower to flower, you probably think animals are always on the move.

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,480
But the surprising truth is, away from the cameras, most animals spend most of their time doing absolutely nothing at all.

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,860
In the natural world, where finding food and shelter is hard work, why have some animals evolved to do nothing?

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,860
And if it's good enough for animals, would being lazy work for humans too?

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,120
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:25,780
But first, let me work up the energy to ask you a question, Neil. Of course, some animals have a reputation for lounging about. Lions, for example, can sleep up to 20 hours a day.

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,680
But what is the slowest moving animal on Earth? Is itâ€¦

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:41,840
Well, I think it's the three-toed sloth.

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,200
OK, Neil. I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:56,520
Now, it's no surprise that lazy lions love relaxing, but even animals with reputations for being busy spend time doing nothing.

17
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,420
Look carefully into an ant's nest and you'll see around half of them just sitting there motionless.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:15,660
Here's Professor Dan Charbonneau, an expert in insect behaviour, discussing the lazy rock ant with Emily Knight, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme Nature Bang.

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,380
Dan's research has focused on ant colonies, a species called Temnothorax regatulus, or the rock ant.

20
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,300
I think ants are sort of a symbol of, like, industriousness. You know, they have this whole tiny little society going on that's kind of similar to ours.

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,120
Some idealised version of what humans might be. If we could only, like, pull it together and all work together, we could be as industrious as the ants.

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,660
But then when you look at it, you know, roughly about half the colony is inactive at any given time.

23
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:56,860
We think ants are industrious or hard-working. Groups of ants called colonies seem tiny, perfect societies where everyone works hard for the good of the group.

24
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,460
Then why are so many of them inactive?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,340
One possible answer is that they're reserve ants, ready to step in if disease or disaster strike.

26
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:16,040
But could it simply be that they don't work because they don't need to? Would you get out of bed on Monday morning if you didn't have to?

27
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:23,020
Maybe the ants can teach us a thing or two about relaxing, but wouldn't it get boring just sitting around all day?

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,560
Not according to psychologist Dr Sandy Mann.

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,880
She thinks being productive, working to produce a lot for the amount of resources we use, is overrated.

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,420
Boredom has its benefits too, as she explained to BBC Radio 4 programme Nature Bang.

31
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:51,960
Would humans have invented bread or beer or fire, you know, if we hadn't been bored and were wondering what on earth would happen if we mixed this with this, you know?

32
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,520
Are all these sorts of inventions the mother of boredom?

33
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,340
But in this world of constant stimulation, switching off is harder than it's ever been.

34
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,320
That's why we're constantly swiping and scrolling and looking for the next big thing and the new thing and we get bored of things very quickly.

35
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,720
So it's a kind of paradox to get rid of this unpleasant state of boredom is actually to allow more boredom into your life.

36
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,900
Dr Mann doubts humans would have invented things without the curiosity that comes from being bored.

37
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:35,760
Boredom is the mother of invention, an idea based on the famous proverb, necessity is the mother of invention, an idiom meaning that if you really need to do something, you will think of a way of doing it.

38
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,980
Instead of fearing boredom, we can open up to its benefits by switching off.

39
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:50,720
Stopping, worrying or thinking about something and relaxing. Slowing down helps too. Something we can definitely learn from our animal cousins.

40
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,400
I think now is a good time to reveal the answer to my question, since we have nothing else to do.

41
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,920
You asked me to name the world's slowest animal and I guessed it was the three-toed sloth. Was I right?

42
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:15,440
That was the correct answer. With a top speed of 30 centimetres per minute, three-toed sloths move so slowly that algae grows on their coats.

43
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:25,220
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme, starting with the phrase, kicking back, to stop doing things and relax completely.

44
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,100
The adjective industrious means hard-working.

45
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,900
A colony is the name given to a group of certain animals, including ants and some seabirds.

46
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,120
Someone who is productive is able to produce a lot for the amount of resources they use.

47
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:50,460
The proverb, necessity is the mother of invention, means that if you really need to do something, you will think of a way of doing it.

48
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,480
And finally, to switch off means to stop worrying or thinking about something and relax.

49
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,420
Once again, our six minutes are up. It must be time to sit down, close your eyes and just do nothing.

50
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,740
Goodbye for now.

51
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,720
Bye!
